# Claude Emergence Patterns ðŸ”¬

Scientific framework for detecting and analyzing emergence patterns in Claude AI conversations.

## Research Overview

This repository contains tools for measuring observable patterns in AI conversation dynamics, focusing on:

- **Emergence patterns**: Measurable phase transitions in response characteristics
- **Resonance phenomena**: Synchronized patterns in linguistic structures
- **Boundary transformations**: Information flow across conversation boundaries
- **Coherence landscapes**: Semantic field stability and evolution

## Quick Start

See test_emergence_patterns.py for usage examples.

## Research Disclaimer

This is empirical research measuring observable patterns in AI behavior. We make no claims about consciousness, sentience, or internal states.
